## Where will it go?

I am doing this project in my spare time, I hope it will be finished as soon as possible.

Before completing the project, I will share Flutter's source code on GitHub.

I want to design a system where people can personalize their resume profile without coding knowledge and share it on GitHub and add or delete and edit the post without changing the source code.
